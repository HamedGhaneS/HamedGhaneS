# Hamed Ghane

**Neuroscientist • Control Engineer • AI Researcher**

---

My name is Hamed, I am a neuroscientist with a PhD in Control Engineering. I am driven by understanding how the brain works and building intelligent systems that bridge neuroscience and artificial intelligence. Brain-computer interfaces have been the main focus of my research, combining real-time neural signal processing with adaptive control systems to create technologies that enhance human capabilities.
